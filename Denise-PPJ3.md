Denise Payumo PPJ Week 4

**Tasks:**

**Total Hours: 5 hrs 20 min**

**Entry** 

This week wasn't super productive for me in terms of this project, but I created my own font for the game, got started on refamiliarizing myself with Unity, and tried importing some of the sample assets I made to make a mock Main Menu screen. I wasn't able to attend our team's weekly meeting this week as I was working for longer than I thought I would be. I plan to pick up the slack and work alongside them more in the following week.

(Above) This is the custom font I made for the game. I may change or make another one later on. This is what I will be using in the game for now.



**Looking ahead:**

I plan to implement the main menu and basic functionality before the first milestone, then I will start creating the first iteration of the win/loss screen, and the heartbeat / heartbeat indicator UI as well as whatever UI assets that need to be created before the first milestone and alpha. I will keep in touch with my team members in case they need any assistance or any additional assets from me.
