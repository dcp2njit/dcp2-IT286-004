# PPJ 8: 
Denise Payumo PPJ Week 9

**Tasks:**

- Weekly meeting 4/2 - 2 Hr
- Create RadialSkillcheck - 8 hrs
- Create RattlingDoor hallucination object - 3 hrs
- Create ScoreManager and edit game over screens to display stats - 4 hrs

**Total Hours: 17 hrs**

**Entry** 

As the playtest and beta deadlines get closer, I've been trying to make sure as many of the necessary features are in as possible so that we can get the most out of the feedback we receive. I've been working towards completing the door hallucination events. I created a modular radial skillcheck that will be used by both the left door and the right door. I created the rattling door (left door) hallucination object using a template script that Thomas kindly made for the team to use. I created a scoremanager to track stats for heartbeat hits and hallucination events. Michael has been working on the animations for the doors, and once he's done with that I will integrate it into the hallucination object scripts. Paulo recorded some heavy breathing sounds and I sliced them into individual audio clips in Audacity for us to use as potential SFX for heartbeat misses and other things. I have a lot in mind that I want to include before playtesting, so I'm gonna utilize the next few days to get as much done as I can.

(Above) Screenshot of me being more direct with Daniel instead of letting it go like I usually do T-T and also him following through :)

I've been trying to stay more on top of things, especially in terms of managing the team. Last month I asked Daniel to provide us with drawings for posters to be used in the environment, which consisted of simple quick doodles. He hasn't been as cooperative as I hoped he'd be so I tried being a little more direct with him. It was hard to do because it felt harsh, but in the end it worked out and he followed through with what I asked of him. I'm thinking he can turn this into something he can incorporate into his contract since I believe all he had was the models(?), so I proposed additional tasks for him to do after completing all the drawings. He didn't get back to me about his contract so I'm not sure where he stands on all that yet.

**Looking ahead:**
- I want to incorporate the animations and sounds into the hallucinations
- I want to work with Paulo to add more audio feedback to the interactions in the game (heartbeat mechanic, hallucinations, etc)
- I want to add a simple jumpscare before the playtest/beta
- I want to add a simple opening text-only intro that introduces the narrative, the objective, and the controls to the player
- I want to create a survey for the playtesters to take after playtesting
