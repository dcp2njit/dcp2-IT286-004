# PPJ 13 (Final PPJ): 
Denise Payumo PPJ Week 14

**Tasks:**

I'd say my major contributions to the project were the creation of the game's UI, creating the radial skillcheck and door hallucination events using the foundation Thomas built for hallucination objects, working with Paulo to create and implement an audio dictionary and manager, and helping to manage the team/project. I tried my best to fill in the gaps where help was needed while doing my main objectives (the UI)

**Positives:**

Overall, I'm proud of what the team was able to accomplish. For the most part we were able to meet the criteria we set for ourselves and that's something to be proud of. I like to think that the game gave the team an opportunity to showcase their skills and/or learn something new. I was impressed by what my other team members were able to accomplish, such as Thomas' programming of the logic, Thomas and Michael's animations, and Paulo, Daniel, and Michael's models and artwork. 
Despite the bumps we faced throughout the project's development, the team was very receptive and adaptable.
Utilizing Github Desktop, Github Issues, and holding regular meetings to discuss tasks and progress was crucial to the game's development. Open and consistent communication is important, which I knew, but I further lurned the importance of through this project.

**Negatives:** 

The most difficult thing about this project was having to juggle it alongside the other projects I had for other classes. If I had more time to focus on Parasomnia I would've wanted to polish it way more, add more details/interaction, and fix more of the parts playtesters gave feedback on. I'm a little disappointed we didn't get to include everything we wanted to. I still feel like the game is lacking in terms of satisfying feedback, scariness, and communication of the narrative.
I definitely think I struggled with a lack of direction in the beginning, not knowing what to prioritize nor how to delegate the workload. I now understand the importance of prioritizing functionality over appearance and will keep it in mind in future projects. I learned from this project that I need to improve my workflow and communication skills. I should also try to trust myself more and take more initiative.
