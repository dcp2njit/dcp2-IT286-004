**Entry** 

In preparation for the Alpha build submission, we decided to hold an impromptu meeting the night before to push all our final touches, work on and finalize the presentation slideshow and progress pdf. During the meeting I did a small bandaid fix for the current heartbeat mechanic audio. I noticed in Paulo's script he made it so that the sound would play whenever the player pressed SPACE, but that logic doesn't make the audio play in time with the hit indicator. I told him about it and asked if I could do a bandaid fix for the alpha, so I disabled the script Paulo made for now and edited Thomas' hitindicator script to play the sound whenever the hit indicator was in the hit window. It's still scuffed so I definitely want to look into refining that next with Paulo. Thomas and I also worked on the slideshow and document together, he created the alpha build of the game and recorded our demo video, and I used his video to create the gifs included in the slides.

(Above) Concept art for a portential poster to be seen in the room, I drew this up to give Daniel an additional idea of what kind of art he could make for the posters. When I made this I was thinking of using it as a subtle way to hint to the player that they're actually in a nightmare.

Looking back at how the presentation went I honestly feel really bad, especially for Thomas. I was running on no sleep that day and I had a lot I wanted to say about our progress and what we're gonna work on next to help Thomas out, but I butchered it so badly when I tried. It felt really disorganized again, and it didn't help that Daniel wasn't able to show up to our meeting and didn't check out the slideshow when I sent it to him to look over before class. Maybe I didn't do a good enough job of communicating to him or asking him to get involved, but it's hard to do so without feeling like I'm being too demanding. I'm struggling to find a way to make the process smoother for everyone and get over these bumps. If I'm being honest my mental has been pretty bad recently and I can't help but feel like I'm at fault because of my lack of experience when it comes to managing a project and a group of people like this. I want to make things fair and I want everyone to have a fruitful learning experience through this project. Right now it feels like I'm doing a lot yet not enough at the same time and it's hard not to feel bad, but I definitely want to take all of this as a lesson to learn from.
(sorry for the rant)

**Looking ahead:**
- I want to reevaluate the work distribution and the priorities of the upcoming tasks.
- I want to work with paulo to set up a scriptable object for our sound library, and work on refining the feedback for the current mechanics we have right now.
- I plan to work on implementing the pause menu
