**Entry** 

In preparation for the Alpha build submission, we decided to hold an impromptu meeting the night before to push all our final touches, work on and finalize the presentation slideshow and progress pdf. During the meeting I did a small bandaid fix for the current heartbeat mechanic audio. I noticed in Paulo's script he made it so that the sound would play whenever the player pressed SPACE, but that logic doesn't make the audio play in time with the hit indicator. I told him about it and asked if I could do a bandaid fix for the alpha, so I disabled the script Paulo made for now and edited Thomas' hitindicator script to play the sound whenever the hit indicator is in the hit window. It's still scuffed so I definitely want to look into refining that next with Paulo. Thomas and I also worked on the slideshow and document together, he created the alpha build of the game and recorded our demo video, and I used his video to create the gifs included in the slides. 


**Milestone Description**

In terms of milestones, I completed everything I needed to so far with the main menu, win/loss screen, and heartbeat mechanic UI. I definitely have a lot more UI to plan out and work, specifically for the game mechanics. I want there to be on-screen instructions or a starting tutorial, and I want to add visual elements that will improve the mechanics' look and feel. I helped Paulo in terms of sound assets when it came to the heartbeat audio in particular with what I mentioned above in my entry.

Looking back at how the presentation went I honestly feel really bad, especially for Thomas since he's been doing a lot for the project in general and helped me a lot with the alpha slides and document. I was running on no sleep that day and I had a lot I wanted to say about our progress and what we're gonna work on next to help Thomas out, but I butchered it so badly when I tried. It felt really disorganized again, and it didn't help that Daniel wasn't able to show up to our meeting and didn't check out the slideshow when I sent it to him to look over before class. I probably should've included more information on the slides too, but I was hoping other people would elaborate more on the work they did since I may have missed the intricacies of their tasks. Maybe I didn't do a good enough job of communicating to them or asking them to get involved, but it's hard to do so without feeling like I'm being too demanding. I'm struggling to find a way to make the process smoother for everyone and get over these bumps. If I'm being honest my mental has been pretty bad recently and it's been affecting my ability to stay on top of things. I also can't help but feel like I'm at fault because of my lack of experience when it comes to game design and managing a project/group of people like this. I want to make things fair and I want everyone to have a fruitful learning experience through this project. I've been realizing how messy our initial appraoch to planning the project and tracking progress was messy, and that's most likely due to the game idea not having been fully fleshed out from the beginning and us prioritizing the wrong things, which again is my fault ðŸ˜­ Right now it feels like I have been doing a lot yet not enough at the same time and it's hard not to feel bad, but I definitely want to take all of this as a lesson to learn from.
(sorry for the rant)

**Looking ahead:**
- I want to reevaluate the work distribution and the priorities of the upcoming tasks.
- I want to work with paulo to set up a scriptable object for our sound library, and work on refining the feedback for the current mechanics we have right now.
- I plan to work on implementing the pause menu
