**Entry** 

Last week I practiced importing my UI assets to unity in a dummy project file so I wouldn't mess anything up in my branch. This week I began implementing the basic Main menu and game win/loss screen onto my actual branch, integrating it with the files from main. I got the main menu start and options buttons to work, but I have nothing in the options menu for now. I also created a game loss screen with working buttons that allow the player to restart the game or return back to the main menu. I included text in the game loss screen to potentially display how long the player was able to last before losing, I will see if I'll be able to implement that functionality myself or work with Thomas to do so as the game's mechanics become more refined. The game win/loss screens currently cannot be prompted to appear, but I have already created them so they'll be ready for i
