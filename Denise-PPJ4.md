**Entry** 

This week wasn't super productive for me in terms of this project, but I created my own font for the game, got started on refamiliarizing myself with Unity, and tried importing some of the sample assets I made to make a mock Main Menu screen. I wasn't able to attend our team's weekly meeting this week as I was working for longer than I thought I would be. I plan to pick up the slack and work alongside them more in the following week.
