**Entry** 

Last week I practiced importing my UI assets to unity in a dummy project file so I wouldn't mess anything up in my branch. This week I began implementing the basic Main menu and game win/loss screen onto my actual branch, integrating it with the files from main. I got the main menu start and options buttons to work, but I have nothing in the options menu for now. I also created a game loss screen with working buttons that allow the player to restart the game or return back to the main menu. I included text in the game loss screen to potentially display how long the player was able to last before losing, I will see if I'll be able to implement that functionality myself or work with Thomas to do so as the game's mechanics become more refined. The game win/loss screens currently cannot be prompted to appear yet, but I have already created them so they'll be ready for integration later on, which I believe Thomas should have partially started for his milestone. After meeting with the team I worked with Thomas to merge my our branches into main so that he would be able to use my assets to complete his tasks for the milestone.

(Above) This is one of the versions of my concept art for the game win screen, with stats I'd like to add later. Ideally the win screen would score the player and show them their stats, showing how well they performed and what they missed.

So far everyone on the team has been very cooperative and supportive, but to be honest it has been a bit difficult to keep track of Daniel and his own progress, especially since he's not as available as everyone else. He did a lot of great work modeling the entire room, but we ran into a problem during one of our meetings this week. Michael brought it to our attention that Daniel's models were not properly optimized to be imported into Unity as separate objects that could be animated, and he took initiative and decided it would be easier to just rebuild the model from scratch basing it off of Daniel's original model and the finalized concept sketch, instead of him or Daniel having to edit the existing file. I made sure to update Daniel on this as well as assigning him another task before moving forward since he was unable to attend the meeting that night. I don't want him to feel like his work was wasted because it wasn't. I just hope moving forward we'll have more opportunities to work closer with Daniel.

**Looking ahead:**
- In the coming week we plan to merge everyone's branches as we prepare for the alpha build
- I will be working on a pause menu next, and as the game starts to come together, I will also plan out what kind of settings I will put in the options menu and slowly implement them. 
- I also realized the game will need some sort of introduction or tutorial for the player to introduce the mechanics and controls, so I've begun brainstorming how I will present this information to the player through the UI. I will build upon it as the game develops, but it will probably be implemented further down the line.
