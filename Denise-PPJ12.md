**Entry** 

I haven't had much time to put in all the changes I wanted to before this deadline. I've been struggling to juggle the work in this final stretch of the semester, but I hope we'll be able to polish the game more before the final showcase. I worked on the pause menu and added some settings to it, and added more of the sounds Paulo found into the game. I wrote out a paragraph about my vision for the game for Paulo's patch notes. I still want to add more to the tutorial, but since I didn't get to, I added a help/objectives menu to give players more context if they need it. I also made a volume slider and it took me a while to figure out how to get it working with the audio manager / audio dictionary.


**Milestone Description**

In terms of my milestone: I previously improved the win/loss screen by including player stats through a score manager that tracks hallucination events and heartbeat hits. I created the door hallucination events and created the skillcheck microgame to accompany them, and I've been working with the audio dictionary/manager to add more of the sounds that Paulo and I have been finding into the game. Before the second playtest I added a UI jumpscare element for the door events using a sound effect that Michael found, and added visual indicators to the heart and hit indicator sprites.

I've added more functionality to the pause menu. I didn't get to add more to the tutorial, so I added a help/objectives section. I added a volume slider and a toggle for one of the shader effects to the options as well.

I'm starting to think that some of the things I was envisioning for the final won't be possible anymore, but we'll do what we can.

**Looking ahead:**
- I want to help improve the heartbeat mechanic's visual feedback for perfect, early, late, and missed hits.
- I want to create a more threatening atmosphere and add jumpscares
- I want to help Thomas improve the tutorial
- I want to add more visual/audio hallucinations (not necessarily events)
