**Entry** 

Since I finished most of what was needed for the milestone and alpha build from my end I don't really have too much on my plate right now. Now I've just been trying to brainstorm for the coming weeks and offering help where its needed. I asked Paulo if I could help him with picking out sounds for the game and he said sure. I felt the heartbeat sound we currently had would be difficult to work with our mechanic moving forward since it was muffled and included multiple beats/ambient background noise, so I tried to search for free to use heartbeat sounds that I could isolate into a single heartbeat, as well as a separate sound for ambience. I found multiple heartbeat sounds to use and I used Audacity to edit them into single heartbeats, and I found two different sounds of ambience for the bedroom-- one normal, and the other a little more eerie which I felt could be overlayed on top of the first sound in moments of heightened fear. I showed the sounds to the rest of the team and I think most of them liked it; I'll have to work with Paulo some more and probably Thomas to see if it'll work well with our current mechanic.

(Above) Concept art for a portential poster to be seen in the room, I drew this up to give Daniel an additional idea of what kind of art he could make for the posters. When I made this I was thinking of using it as a subtle way to hint to the player that they're actually in a nightmare.

I wasn't able to attend our weekly meeting because of work, but it wasn't much of a problem because I had already merged my work that is needed for the alpha into main. I made sure to communicate that to the rest of the team though and remind them to prioritize merging their own work into the main branch to prepare for the alpha, which Thomas updated me on and said they were able to do successfully during the meeting. 


**Looking ahead:**
- I will continue working on the pause menu and implementing it into the game, and as the game starts to come together, I will also plan out what kind of settings I will put in the options menu and slowly implement them. 
- I will continue brainstorming on how to introduce the mechanics/gameplay
- I will begin making the second iteration og the heartbeat UI; I want to play around with pixel art, and hopefully shift the UI's style to become more pixelated
- I would like to take a stab at scripting and help Paulo with the sounds
