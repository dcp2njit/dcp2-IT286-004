**Entry** 

After feeling like the team was disorganized when it came to the project pitch, I spent this week I spent time trying to reframe all the ideas the team came up with during brainstorming and make a game design document to solidify the ideas and features so that everyone will have something to add/refer to as we progress with the project. I then began adding to the team contract, referring to the sample contract on canvas this time to make sure we had every section we needed, and the team agreed to meet on Discord to finalize the details on the contract before submitting it. We created a more detailed roadmap/timeline, and compared to what we started with when we initially pitched the project, we ended up changing a lot of things in terms of the game's narrative, and the features we would actually include and prioritize.

During the online meeting on 2/12 the team discussed more specifics and established tasks, and we made a channel in the discord for each person to keep track of and provide updates on their progress as we work towards the alpha build. I was a little confused on how github branches worked so I tested it out with Thomas and now the process makes a lot more sense to me. Excited to continue moving forward.

**Looking ahead:**

After our last meeting, we decided that we will be holding weekly online discord meetings on Wednesdays at 5-6pm.
The team is going to begin working towards their personal milestones, ultimately working to develop the alpha build.
I am going to begin sketching out concept art for in-game UI and the win/loss screen, as well as concept art for other things.
