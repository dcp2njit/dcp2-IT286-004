**Entry** 

After feeling like the team was disorganized when it came to the project pitch, I spent this week I spent time trying to reframe all the ideas the team came up with during brainstorming and make a game design document to solidify the ideas and features so that everyone will have something to add/refer to as we progress with the project. I then began making adding to the team contract, referring to the sample contract on canvas this time to make sure we had every section we needed, and the team agreed to meet on Discord to finalize the details on the contract before submitting it. We created a more detailed roadmap/timeline, and compared to what we started with when we initially pitched the project, we ended up changing a lot of things in terms of the game's narrative, and the features we would actually include and prioritize.
