**Entry** 
After 10 hours of continuous brainstorming and working with my team on Discord to come to terms on a game idea and complete all the documents due tomorrow, I am exhausted. I appreciate my teammates being so cooperative and receptive, and sticking around for such a long time. We spent hours bouncing ideas off each other and refining them before even getting started on the actual documents. I’m happy we made a lot of progress and I think the initial barebones idea of a horror rhythm game evolved into something pretty solid. Thomas was especially helpful to work with as his previous experience in making games helped steer the conversation in terms of what aspects to prioritize.

(Above) Here are pictures of some of the fleshed out game mechanics we mapped out on our brainstorming document during our Discord meeting. 

I do have to say I feel bad for Daniel because he missed a majority of the meeting since he had a 6-9 class. He was there for the first hour, but left and missed most of the development of the ideas. We asked him to rejoin the call once he had the time and tried to catch him up to speed with our more refined game idea, but he still had to leave early so he wasn’t around to work as long as everyone else was. Hopefully we’ll have more time moving forward to work together as a complete team.

**Looking ahead:**

The team will need to start creating an outline / roadmap for the nitty gritty of the project, assigning more specific tasks/responsibilities and organizing weekly/biweekly online meetings for designated work-time. 
I would like to further refine and solidify the concepts of the game in terms of art direction, and I want all the programmers to prioritize learning how to make the main mechanic– the rhythm game
