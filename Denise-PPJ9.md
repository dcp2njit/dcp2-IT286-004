**Total Hours: 12 hrs**

**Entry** 

We held the playtest online on our Discord server with a section dedicated to playtesting. I would've preferred to have done it in person, but doing it online was better for convenience considering everyone's distance / misaligned schedules. In the end it worked out and we got valuable feedback that will help us moving forward. I was hoping to be able to implement Michael's animations with the door hallucination events I made, as well as some jumpscares, but I kept running into some problems with the animator so I had to cut my losses. I also wanted to include more of Daniel and Paulo's art/models in the game before the beta but we were only able to include some. I dedicated a slide in the presentation to showing off their art/models/animations some of which were not able to be implemented in time for the beta submission.

**Milestone Description**

In terms of my milestone: I improved the win/loss screen by including player stats through a score manager that tracks hallucination events and heartbeat hits. I tweaked some of my scripts for the menu buttons to (hopefully) fix some of the bugs we encountered during the playtest. I created the door hallucination events and created the skillcheck microgame to accompany them, and I utilized the audio dictionary/manager that Paulo and I worked on to play spatial sounds from each door. The main menu and the options are still untouched, but I will prioritize that last as I want to focus on other aspects of the game first.

I said I wanted to add the intro/tutorial section, but I let Thomas take over so that we would have some sort of tutorial for the playtest since he was able to complete it much faster (and better) than I would've. It still needs a lot of work, so I think I'll try to help improve the tutorial for the final.
(Not gonna lie I forgot I put that in my contract)

**Looking ahead:**
- I want to incorporate the animations that Michael made into the hallucination events.
- I want to work with Paulo to add more audio feedback to the interactions in the game (heartbeat mechanic, hallucinations, etc)
- I want to help improve the heartbeat mechanic's visual feedback for perfect, early, late, and missed hits.
- I want to create a more threatening atmosphere and add jumpscares
- I want to help Thomas improve the tutorial
- I want to add more visual/audio hallucinations (not necessarily events)
